# AI ColourPal - FLUX Color Consistency Project
## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to determining the tokens needed for the image generation model FLUX ito consistently producing accurate colours. After rigorous testing and analysis, this project provides a curated list of over 1,500 color descriptions that FLUX interprets with some degree of fidelity, along with their corresponding hexadecimal codes.

## Project Structure
/colours.csv: Contains the list of colour strings and their predicted hexadecimal values, along with an average colour distance representing colour cosistency (the lower the better) 

/color-samples: Features examples generated by FLUX for each color.

/find_colour_prompt.py: Script that takes a hexadecinal rgb colour and suggests a string to prompt for accurate colour results 

## Methodology
### Step 1: Initial Color Selection
We began with a list of approximately 1,500 popular color names from databases of paint pigments and free color tables such as HTML, X11, NTC, as well as some script generated colours using standard descriptors and basic colour names (e.g. 'pale' and 'green'). FLUX was tasked with generating a simple color swatch for each name. Colors that resulted in swatches with dominating unrelated objects or incorrect interpretations were excluded from further tests.

### Step 2: T-Shirt Generation
For the colors that passed the initial test, FLUX was used to generate images of t-shirts. This helped in evaluating the model's consistency in more complex renderings.

### Step 3: Central Square Analysis
From each pair of generated images (swatches and t-shirts), a central square (33% of the total area) was extracted. These squares were compared using the CIEDE2000 color space to measure the color accuracy between the swatch and the t-shirt images.

### Step 4: Additional Imagery and Final Assessment
Further testing involved generating images of cats, houses, walls, scenes, planets, mugs and wooden panels in the selected colors. These images underwent a final round of color accuracy evaluation using comparison scores. Some colours that showed low fidelity across tests were excluded from the final list.

### Step 5: Manual Tweaking
We ran an analysis on the RGB colour space to check for colours that were not well represented in our database any manually added some colour labels to test, then ran steps 2-4 again.

## Contribute
We welcome contributions and suggestions to enhance the accuracy and utility of this dataset:
Data Analysis: Help refine comparison techniques or introduce new metrics.
Model Testing: Propose other methods for generating and evaluating color accuracy. Test on other image generation models.
### Usage
Feel free to use this dataset for both academic and commercial purposes. We ask that you cite this repository if you publish results that make use of this data.
### Disclaimer
Some colour names are trademarked. This colour list is for information only and if you wish to use any of the colours we've tested in your prompts, further legal advice may be needed.
